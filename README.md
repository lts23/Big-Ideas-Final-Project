What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?

Introduction:
We came up with aspects of what we thought made good neighborhoods, then used Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center to find datasets that supported each of our metrics. We decided to determine which neighborhood is best by analyzing which had the most features of a city, like shops and food places, as well as features of a suburb, like the quiet and green areas.

1. Major Roads - Leah

This metric measures how many miles of main roads go through each of the neighborhoods. Where there are main roads, there are numerous ammenities such as shops and food places, so more appealing neighborhoods will have more miles of major roads in them. The 2010 Transportation dataset provides the data.

2. Bridges - Cole

This metric measures the amount of bridges in each neighborhood. The more bridges, the more appealing the neighborhood is because bridges usually come with water sources. With water sources there's more activities to do and more possibilities of having green areas and paths for people to run, walk and bike. The City of Pittsburgh Bridges dataset provides the data.
  
3. Traffic - Tyler

This metric measures the amount of daily car traffic per neighborhood. Lots of daily car traffic leads to noise, an increase in potential car crashes, and crowded streets. Even though major roads lead to more traffic, ideal neighborhoods have streets that connect to the major roads, but aren't traffic-heavy themselves. The City of Pittsburgh Traffic Count dataset provides the data.

The Metric:

The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.

Conclusion: Reflect on how the data driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.

Leah - My personal favorite neighborhood in Pittsburgh is Shady Side. It's my favorite because it has a strip of shops and food places, but it's not as crowded and chaotic as Oakland. Shady Side also has beautiful big homes, with big yards, which you can't usually find in a city. This critera is the same as what our metric analyzes because Shady Side combines the attractions of a city with the looks of a suburb.

Tyler - Personally, I have a hard time picking a favorite neighborhood. If I had to choose within the city limits, I think Crafton/Ingram would be my top picks. They're more familiar to me, as the buildings there remind me of my hometown. Obviously compared to the final metric, my picks are nowhere near the "best"

Question: Do you think any of our three metrics have a greater value than the others?
