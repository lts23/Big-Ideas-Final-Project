Introduction: Introduce the project, your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.

The Metric: 
1. Major Roads (Transportation 2010) Leah
2. Crime Rates (Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data) Cole
3. Traffic (City of Pittsburgh Traffic Count) Tyler

Describe your metric, what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?
The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.

Conclusion: Reflect on how the data driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.
