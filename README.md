What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?

Introduction:
We came up with aspects of what we thought made good neighborhoods, then used Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center to find datasets that supported each of our metrics.

(Describe your metric, what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?)

1. Major Roads - Leah

This metric measures how many miles of main roads go through each of the neighborhoods. Where there are main roads, there are numerous ammenities such as shops and food places. The 2010 Transportation dataset provides the data.

2. Bridges (-) Cole
  
3. Traffic - Tyler

This metric measures the amount of daily car traffic per neighborhood. Lots of daily car traffic leads to noise, an increase in potential car crashes, and crowded streets. Even though major roads lead to more traffic, ideal neighborhoods have streets that connect to the major roads, but aren't traffic-heavy themselves. The City of Pittsburgh Traffic Count dataset provides the data.

The Metric:

The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.

Conclusion: Reflect on how the data driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.
