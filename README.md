What is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh?

Introduction:
We came up with aspects of what we thought made good neighborhoods, then used Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center to find datasets that supported each of our metrics.

1. Major Roads - Leah
This metric measures how many miles of main roads go through each of the neighborhoods. Where there are main roads, there are numerous ammenities such as shops and food places. The 2010 Transportation dataset provides the data.

2. Bridges (-) Cole
  
3. Traffic (City of Pittsburgh Traffic Count) Tyler
This metric measures the amount of daily car traffic per neighborhood. Lots of daily car traffic leads to noise, an increase in potential car crashes, and crowded streets. 

Describe your metric, what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?
The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.

Conclusion: Reflect on how the data driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.
